I don't know that many songs particularly stood out, but nice vibes and a kinda \"falling apart\" type feeling most of the way through. Like it felt rickety somehow?",

On Out Ta Get Me right now, and it hasn't slowed down once yet.\n\nA little bit AC/DC-ish in the bit of sameness from song to song, but man do GnR know how to execute. And a good reminder of why I always loved Slash as a guitar player.\n\nYep, excellent album. Classic, loud, in your face rock music. Awesome guitar work, and tons of attitude. Glad to have a reason to revisit this one.",
